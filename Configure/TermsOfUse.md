If you are under the age of majority, you must ask your parent or guardian to read and accept this EULA on your behalf before you use our Products. You may not use or access our Products if you (or your parent or guardian) do not agree to this EULA.

3. Amendments to This EULA
3.1. From time to time, we may need to amend this EULA for serious reasons, for example to reflect new features and functionalities in the Products, to enhance security of our users, or to comply with changes in law.

3.2. We will notify you of the changes via e-mail or on other durable medium no later than 30 calendar days before such changes come into force. In the notification, we will inform you about the changes, your right to object, the notice period and the legal consequences of a failure to object. We will also communicate to you the text of the updated EULA. Where permitted by law, we reserve the right to send such notice via other commonly used notification mechanisms (for example, in-game pop-up message or a message in the account management section) reasonably in advance.

3.3. We will obtain your consent where required by law. Otherwise, you shall be deemed to have accepted the changes unless you have notified us of your objection to such changes within thirty (30) calendar days from the moment of receiving the notification from us.

3.4. In case you object to any changes, the previous version of the EULA shall continue to apply. However, in that case we may close your Account and terminate this EULA with 14 calendar days’ notice. Also, if you disagree with the changes, you can terminate the EULA by deleting your Account using the “Account Deletion” tool in your Account Management here and, for console Products, here and here.

Changes to this EULA shall not affect your accrued rights and shall not have retroactive effect.

4. Your Wargaming Account
Creating an Account

4.1. You need to create a Wargaming account to use all features of our Products. A Wargaming account is a collection of data associated with a particular individual that is required for his or her use of the Products, including authentication (authorisation), access to settings, statistics and other information, and use of Paid Items (the “Account”).

4.2. To create an Account, you must have a valid and non-disposable e-mail address and will be required to provide certain information about you. You must provide this information truthfully and accurately and keep it up to date, so that we have correct details about you and your Account. If expressly permitted in the Product, you may also create an Account and log in through a third-party system.

4.3. When creating an Account, you will be required to provide an in-game name (“Nickname”) to represent you in our Products. Your Nickname cannot be transferred to another person, and you may not use a Nickname that is used by someone else. However, we may allow other players to use your Nickname if your Account is deleted.

4.4. To use our Products on third-party platforms, you need to have a separate account on those platforms. Also, you must comply with the terms and conditions set by those third-party platforms.

4.5. If expressly permitted by Wargaming, a “demo account” is possible in certain Products. In this case, you will not receive a separate Nickname or password and the authorization for such Product is made through the specific technical device (mobile phone, tablet, etc.) that you use. However, you are strongly advised to set up a standard Account in accordance with the above provisions. If a “demo account” is used, your progress in a Product may be lost in case you lose access to your technical device or its software is modified.

No Account Sharing or Account Transfer

4.6. Your Account is personal to you and must not be shared, transferred, or traded with any other person. At no time should you disclose your password and other login credentials to anyone. This includes your friends, children, spouses, co-workers, clan members, and/or clan leaders.

4.7. If you share or transfer your Account, you may be responsible for the conduct and actions of third parties using your Account, including for all violations of this EULA. We reserve the right to suspend access to your Account or to close your Account and terminate this EULA in accordance with sections 19.4-19.9 “Suspension or Termination by Wargaming” of this EULA if we discover Account sharing or transfer.

Security of Your Account

4.8. You must ensure that you secure your Account, computer, mobile phone or other device on which you use our Products from third party access. Please notify us immediately if you become aware of:

a. Any unauthorised use of your Account or any other breach of security; or

b. Any hacking tools being used or that might be used in relation to our Products.

4.9. We have implemented physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to help safeguard and prevent unauthorised access, use, alteration, modification and/or disclosure of your Account information. We will have no liability to you for any loss or damage arising from any unauthorised use of your Account or any unauthorised access, use, alteration, modification and/or disclosure of your personal data to the extent it arises from your culpable omissions or negligent conduct. We reserve the right to suspend access to your Account if we discover Account hacking. If you believe that we have suspended access to your Account in error, please contact our Player Support.

Deletion of Inactive Accounts

4.10. We may delete your Account if your Account is inactive. Your Account is inactive if you have not logged in your Account for a consecutive period of ten (10) years. We will inform you at least forty-five (45) days before we delete your Account and you will have the possibility to prevent your Account from being deleted by logging into your Account and restoring your Account until the date set out in the information about the planned deletion. When we delete your Account, your personal data will be deleted or anonymized. For more information on how we delete your data, please see our Privacy Policy.
